# docker-cors-anywhere

This gives you a cors proxy to bypass the cors issue when building frontend / serverless application. 

It uses the [cors-anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere) npm package, the same package that powers [https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/).
